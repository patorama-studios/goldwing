# Pages, navigation & menus

## For administrators

### What this is

The public website's pages and menus. Things like the **Home**, **About**, **Membership**, **Events** and **Member Area** pages, plus the menus across the top, the side and the footer that link them together.

When a visitor lands on goldwing.org.au and clicks around, they're moving between these pages through these menus. Admins control all of it from here — no developer needed.

### What you can do

- Edit the content of any page (About, Contact, Membership info, etc.)
- Reorder, indent or hide items in the menus
- Create a brand-new page and add it to a menu
- Mark a page as **members-only** or **admin-only** so the public can't see it
- See every previous version of a page and roll back to one if you make a mistake

### Who's allowed to do this

Two roles can edit pages and menus by default:

- **Admin**
- **Webmaster**

If you can't see **Pages and Nav** in the sidebar, you're not in one of those roles. Ask an admin to change your role.

### Where to find it in admin

{{link:/admin/navigation.php|Take me to Pages and Nav}}

- **Pages list** — Admin sidebar → **Pages**. Lists every page with its slug, title, access level and when it was last updated.
- **Visual page editor** — click any page in the list. The AI-assisted visual builder opens. See [Chapter 24 — AI page builder](view.php?slug=24-ai-page-builder).
- **Menus and navigation slots** — Admin sidebar → **Pages and Nav**.

### The Draft → Live workflow

Every page has two copies of its content:

1. A **draft** — what you're working on. Visitors never see this.
2. A **live** version — what the public actually sees on goldwing.org.au.

You can edit the draft as much as you like — fix typos, restructure, swap photos in and out — and nothing changes on the public site until you click **Publish**. When you publish, the draft replaces the live version and a snapshot of the old live version is saved to the page's version history. That snapshot is your safety net: if the new version turns out to be wrong, you can roll back to any previous version with two clicks.

### How to publish a page (step by step)

{{link:/admin/page-builder|Take me to the page builder}}

1. Admin sidebar → **Pages**.
2. Click the page you want to edit.
3. Make your changes in the visual editor. Save the draft as often as you like — nothing goes live yet.
4. Click **Preview** to see how the draft will look to the public.
5. When you're happy, click **Publish** (sometimes labelled **Push live**).
6. Confirm. The page is now live; the previous version is saved automatically as v(n).

### How to revert to a previous version

{{link:/admin/page-builder|Take me to the page builder}}

1. Open the page in the visual editor.
2. Open the **Version history** panel (a sidebar listing v1, v2, v3 …).
3. Click the version you want to restore. The editor loads it into the **draft** — it doesn't go live yet.
4. Preview to confirm it's the version you wanted.
5. Click **Publish** to make it live again.

This way a rollback always goes through the same draft → preview → publish loop, and you can't accidentally swap live by mistake.

### How to add a new page to the main menu

{{link:/admin/navigation.php|Take me to Pages and Nav}}

1. Create the page first — Admin → **Pages** → **New page**. Give it a title, a slug (the URL ending), and some content. Save and publish it.
2. Admin sidebar → **Pages and Nav**.
3. Pick the **Primary Menu** from the menu dropdown.
4. Click **Add item** → choose **Link to a page** → select the page you just created.
5. Use the **Up / Down / Indent / Outdent** buttons to position it where you want.
6. Save the menu. The change is live straight away (with a small cache delay — see below).

### How to mark a page members-only

{{link:/admin/page-builder|Take me to the page builder}}

Each page has an **Access** dropdown with three settings:

- **Public** — anyone can see it.
- **Members only** — only signed-in members can see it. Non-members see a "sign in to view" prompt.
- **Admin only** — only admins can see it. Useful for staging a page before you flip it to public.

Change the dropdown and save. The change applies on the next page load.

### What can go wrong (and what to do)

- **"I edited the page but the website still shows the old version."** — You saved the draft but didn't publish. Go back into the editor and click **Publish**.
- **"I deleted a page and now the menu shows a broken link."** — Deleting a page doesn't remove menu items pointing at it; they show as **Missing** in the admin. Go to **Pages and Nav**, find the broken item, and either delete it or repoint it.
- **"I broke the menu order."** — Use the version history on the page side; for menus, just re-order them with the Up/Down/Indent buttons until it looks right. Menu changes are easy to fix and don't damage anything.
- **"My change isn't showing up even after publishing."** — Menus are cached for about 60 seconds. Wait a minute and refresh. If it's still wrong, log out and back in (the cache is per-role).
- **"I can't see the Pages sidebar at all."** — You're not an Admin or Webmaster. Ask an admin to grant the role.

### What gets recorded

- **Version history per page** — every publish stores a snapshot. You can see who published it, when, and the label (e.g. `v3 – Update`). Rollback is always possible from this list.
- **Activity log** — every publish, every menu save and every access-level change is logged. Admin → Security Log to search.

### Good practice

- **Always preview before publishing.** The preview button is right there — use it.
- **Check the page on a phone before publishing.** Most of our visitors are on mobile. The visual editor has a "mobile preview" mode.
- **Don't delete pages — unpublish them instead.** Set them to **Admin only** and remove them from menus. That way menus don't break and you can bring the page back later. Only actually delete a page when you're absolutely sure nothing links to it.
- **Use clear slugs.** `about-us` is better than `page-7`. The slug appears in the URL forever, so pick one that still makes sense in a year.
- **Don't put sensitive info on a "Public" page.** If only members should see it, mark it members-only — visibility is not just about menus, it's about who can load the page at all.

### Who to ask if you're stuck

- **Permission issue** — site admin can change roles in Admin → Settings → Accounts & Roles.
- **Page builder is acting up** — see [Chapter 24 — AI page builder](view.php?slug=24-ai-page-builder), or flag it to your developer.
- **You need a new menu location** (e.g. a third sidebar nav somewhere) — that's a template change, ask your developer.

## What this covers

The public CMS-like part of the site: the `pages` table (slug + title + body + visibility + per-page access), the draft → live publishing flow with versioned snapshots, the structured block schema the visual builder edits, and the menus that join those pages into the navigation. AI editing of pages — chat, diffs, model wiring — is the next chapter. This one is the storage and routing layer underneath.

## Why it exists

Two needs collided. The committee wants to update headlines, prices and announcements without a developer redeploy — so pages can't live in PHP files. The team also wants a *visual* editor, and a free-form HTML textarea can't safely round-trip one. So pages store *both* a structured JSON schema (source of truth for the builder) and a flattened HTML render (what the public site serves). A draft buffer on top lets editors stage changes and push live when ready, and every publish snapshots the HTML into `page_versions` so a bad change can be rolled back from the admin UI.

Menus exist for the same reason: the public nav used to be a partial in `app/Views/`. Now it's a database table, a drag-and-drop UI, and three named locations (`primary`, `secondary`, `footer`) that templates render from.

## How it works

### The `pages` table

Each row is one public route. The slug is what `public_html/index.php?page=<slug>` matches on — `home` is special and renders at `/`. Columns of note:

- `slug` — URL-safe identifier (`^[a-z0-9-]+$`).
- `title` — browser title and menu-item label when "use page title" is checked.
- `visibility` — `public`, `member`, or `admin`. Coarse-grained.
- `access_level` — finer-grained, layered on top. Either `public` or `role:<role_key>`. Evaluated by `PageBuilderService::canAccessPage()` *before* `visibility`. See [Chapter 07](view.php?slug=07-roles-permissions).
- `html_content` — legacy/canonical flat HTML the public page renders.
- `draft_html` / `live_html` — the draft buffer and the last-published render. New code writes both; old code only had `html_content`, so `PageService::draftHtml()` / `liveHtml()` fall back through all three.
- `schema_json` — the structured block tree the visual builder edits.

`PageService` is the thin CRUD layer: `getBySlug()`, `getById()`, `listEditablePages()`, `updateDraft()`, `publishDraft()`, `updateContentWithSchema()`. It calls `ensureHomePage()` on first read so a fresh install always has a `home` row to edit.

### Draft → live → version

`updateDraft()` writes only to `draft_html` and `access_level`. The public site never reads `draft_html`, so saving a draft is non-destructive.

`publishDraft()` copies the current draft into `live_html` *and* `html_content`, and the page-builder API endpoint (`/admin/page-builder/api.php?action=publish`) inserts a row into `page_versions` with a new `version_number`, a label like `v3 – Update`, the full HTML snapshot, and the publishing user. Rolling back writes the chosen version's `html_snapshot` back into the draft buffer rather than swapping live directly, so the editor can preview before re-publishing.

The flow is audited (`AuditService::log(..., 'push_live', ...)`) and a system message is dropped into the page's chat log.

### `PageSchemaService` — the block grammar

`PageSchemaService` (683 lines, the biggest service in `app/Services/`) defines and enforces the structured-content schema the visual builder edits. It owns:

- The allowed **layouts** (`default`, `full-width`, `landing`).
- The allowed **block types** — `hero`, `text`, `image`, `gallery`, `video`, `button`, `cta`, `quote`, `faq`, `pricing`, `testimonial`, `form`, `section`, `columns`, `spacer`, `divider`, plus dynamic blocks (`latest_posts`, `upcoming_events`, `user_profile`, `membership_status`, `notifications`).
- Recursive containers (`section` holds blocks; `columns` holds columns that hold blocks) and the logic to apply per-block updates inside the tree (`applyBlockUpdates()`).
- Decode and normalisation helpers for AI responses, so model output can be merged back without trashing the schema.

Everything the AI page builder does goes through this service. If you add a new block type, start here — and teach the renderer to draw it.

### Menus and navigation

`NavigationService` owns three tables: `menus`, `menu_items`, and `menu_locations`.

- A **menu** is a named collection of items (e.g. "Primary Menu").
- A **menu item** has either a `page_id` (link to a CMS page) or a `custom_url` (external link or hard-coded path), plus `parent_id` for nesting and `sort_order` for ordering, both managed by the admin UI's Up / Down / Indent / Outdent buttons.
- A **menu location** is a named slot templates render from. Three are seeded: `primary`, `secondary`, `footer`. Only one menu can be assigned to each location — assigning a new menu replaces the previous binding silently.

`getNavigationTree($locationKey, $user)` is what front-end templates call. It loads the menu bound to the location, builds a parent/child tree, filters out items the user can't see (`canViewPage()` plus path-based access control for custom URLs), and returns the result. Results are cached per-location per-role-set for 60 seconds in `app/cache/nav_*.json`; any menu save calls `clearNavigationCache()` to invalidate.

If no menus exist, `ensureDefaultMenu()` seeds a "Primary Menu" with Home / About / Ride Calendar / Membership / Events + a Member Login custom link, and binds it to `primary`. If a location has no menu assigned, `fallbackNavigation()` returns every public page so the site never renders an empty navbar.

## Where to change it

- **Edit page content (visual):** Admin sidebar → **Pages** → pick a page → opens `/admin/page-builder/`. See [Chapter 24](view.php?slug=24-ai-page-builder).
- **Edit page content (raw):** `/admin/pages/editor.php?id=<n>` (HTML + metadata); `/admin/pages/builder.php?id=<n>` (block-level).
- **List all pages:** `/admin/pages/` (alias `/admin/index.php?page=pages`). Guarded by `admin.pages.edit`.
- **Menus and locations:** Admin sidebar → **Pages and Nav** → `/admin/navigation.php`.
- **Per-page access:** the access dropdown on the page itself (saves via `/admin/page-builder/api.php?action=access`).
- **Public reading path:** `public_html/index.php` resolves `?page=<slug>`, calls `PageService::getBySlug()`, applies `PageBuilderService::canAccessPage()`, and renders `liveHtml()`. Templates pull menus via `NavigationService::getNavigationTree('primary' | 'footer' | …)`.

## Settings

This chapter has no settings of its own in `settings_global`, but two related ones matter:

- `ai.template_header_html` — HTML injected above the page body on every public render.
- `ai.template_footer_html` — same, below the body.

Both are stripped of element IDs (`PageBuilderService::stripElementIds`) before render so they don't collide with the per-page builder IDs. See [Chapter 31](view.php?slug=31-settings-architecture).

## Gotchas

- **Deleting a page leaves menu items orphaned.** `menu_items.page_id` is a soft link (no FK), so deletion hides the item from the public render (LEFT JOIN drops it) but the row stays in `menu_items` showing `status: 'Missing'` in the admin UI. Review menus after deleting a page.
- **`access_level` is separate from `visibility`.** A page can be `visibility: public` but `access_level: role:committee` — the role check wins. If you're debugging "why can't members see this page?", check both columns.
- **The publish endpoint trusts the page ID.** It checks `require_permission('admin.ai_page_builder.publish')` but maintains no explicit allow-list — non-editable pages are kept out by *not appearing in `listEditablePages()`*. Gate system pages there, not at publish time.
- **`schema_json` is the source of truth — flat HTML is a render.** Pasting arbitrary HTML into the raw editor works once, but the next visual edit reconciles against the schema and hand-rolled markup may not round-trip cleanly. For custom layouts, add a block type in `PageSchemaService`.
- **Navigation is cached for 60 seconds per role-set.** Menu saves call `clearNavigationCache()`, but changing a page's `visibility` or `access_level` directly in the DB won't invalidate — clear `app/cache/nav_*.json` or call `NavigationService::clearCache()`.
- **Don't confuse pages with notices.** Notices are short pinned admin messages at `/admin/index.php?page=notices` — separate table, never in menus. If an editor asks "where do I change the banner?", they probably mean notices.
